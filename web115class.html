                Hello! My name is Anirudh Pentakota, I am a High-School student attending GTCC. Ever since I was younger I knew I wanted to do something with computers as a job, growing up I as I researched more I learned about coding. Fast forward a couple of years I attended a summer camp at ID Tech Camp, the camp was at a college near me. After completing the camp I received a certificate stating I am proficient with Python. After highschool, I want to attend UNC Charlotte and major in Computer Science.
